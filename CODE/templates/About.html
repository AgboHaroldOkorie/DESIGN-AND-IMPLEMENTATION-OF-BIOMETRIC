        <p class="lead">  <p class="lead"> This software provided the resource for an individual to personally examine the breast cancer risk level, 
showing that the predisposing risk factors can be reduced by personal health monitoring. Though, 
MFES employed higher number of fuzzy rules unlike the existing systems with less number of 
rules; it supports pre-tumor growth instead of post-tumor growth which was incapable of handling 
the high incidence rate. It is therefore recommended that MFES be used to detect predisposing 
breast cancer risk levels early enough. The main contribution of this work is the reduction of the 
incidence rate in contrast to the existing methods currently applied in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

The main focus of the project is the implementation of data encryption and decryption on patient’s privacy in E-records.
Encrypting sensitive data by default using the logged in user’s secret key which is only known by the logged in user.
Providing a flexible means of changing login password if it is been compromised.
Providing a flexible means of allowing users to change their secret key, by providing a security question and answer which was provided when they created the account and the old key if key has been compromised.
Providing  a security emergency  rule called “glass breaking rule” where only the admin staff can use patient id and his own secret key to get patient secret key to enable doctors see patient record. 
 Finally, to design a system this will help to overcome the problem of stigmatization on patients living with a particular ailment.
